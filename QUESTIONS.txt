1.Write a Python script to concatenate following dictionaries to create a new one. 

Sample Dictionary :
dic1={1:10, 2:20}
dic2={3:30, 4:40}
dic3={5:50,6:60}
Expected Result : {1: 10, 2: 20, 3: 30, 4: 40, 5: 50, 6: 60}


2.Write a Python script to check whether a given key already exists in a dictionary

3. Write a Python program to iterate over dictionaries using for loops.

4. Write a Python script to generate and print a dictionary that contains a number (between 1 and n) in the form (x, x*x). 
Sample Dictionary ( n = 5) :
Expected Output : {1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25}

5. Write a Python program to remove duplicates (values) from Dictionary

6. Write a code to get the key of a minimum value from a dictionary

7. Reverse a list in Python

8. Remove all occurrences of a specific item from a list.

9. Write a Python program to sum all the items in a list

10. Write a Python program to get the second largest number from a list

11. Write a Python program to find the second smallest number in a lis

12. Write a Python program to get unique values from a list.

13. Write a Python program to get count of repetition of each value from a list.

14. Write a Python program to find common items from two lists.

15. Write a Python program to count number of lists in a list of lists.

Use Recursion
-------------
1. Write a Python program to calculate the sum of a list of numbers. 


2. Write a Python program to converting an Integer to a string in any base.


3. Write a Python program of recursion list sum. 


4. Write a Python program to get the factorial of a non-negative integer. 


5. Write a Python program to solve the Fibonacci sequence using recursion.


6. Write a Python program to get the sum of a non-negative integer. Go to the editor


7. Write a Python program to calculate the sum of the positive integers of n+(n-2)+(n-4)... (until n-x =< 0). 


8. Write a Python program to calculate the harmonic sum of n-1. 
Note: The harmonic sum is the sum of reciprocals of the positive integers.


9. Write a Python program to calculate the geometric sum of n-1. 
Note: In mathematics, a geometric series is a series with a constant ratio between successive terms.


10. Write a Python program to calculate the value of 'a' to the power 'b'. 


11. Write a Python program to find  the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two integers. 



Use Comprehension
-----------------

1. Find all of the numbers from 1–1000 that are divisible by 8

2. Find all of the numbers from 1–1000 that have a 6 in them

3. Count the number of spaces in a string (use string above)

4. Remove all of the vowels in a string (use string above)

5. Find all of the words in a string that are less than 5 letters (use string above)

6. Use a dictionary comprehension to count the length of each word in a sentence (use string above)

7. Use a nested list comprehension to find all of the numbers from 1–1000 that are divisible by any single digit besides 1 (2–9)

8. For all the numbers 1–1000, use a nested list/dictionary comprehension to find the highest single digit any of the numbers is divisible by

9. Finding Transpose of a Matrix using List Comprehension
